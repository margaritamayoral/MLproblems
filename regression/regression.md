# Regression searches for relationhsips among variables.
# Examples:

# For example, from a dataset of several employees of some 
# company we can try to understand how their salaries depend
# on the features,such as experience, level of education, role
# city they work in, and so on.
# This is a regression problem where data related to each
# employee represent one observation. The presumption is that
# the experience, education, role, and city are the independent 
# features (xs) while the salary depends on them (y)

# Simlarly, you can try to establish a mathematical dependence of
# the prices of houses on their areas, number of bedrooms, distances
# to the city center, and so on.

# Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon
# of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation
# has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) 
# one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish 
# a relation among them.

# In other words , you need to find a function that maps some features
# or variables to others sufficiently well.

# The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or 
# responses. 

# The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

# Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable.
# The inputs, however, can be continous discrete, or even categorical data
# such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.

# It is a common practice to denote the outputs with y and inputs with x.
# If there are two or more independent variables, they can be represented as the vector
#x = (x1,x2, ..., xn), where n is the number of inputs.

# When do you need regression?

# Typically you need regression to answer wheter and how some phenomenon influences
# the other or how several variables are related. For example you can use it to
# determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

# Regression is also useful whe you want to forecast a response using a new set of
# predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household
# for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents
# in that household.

# Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences,
# ans so on. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of
# data and increased awarness of the practical value of data

# Linear Regression

# Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression
# techniques. It's among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages
# is the easy of interpreting results.
